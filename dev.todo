☐ pipelines list (short description, go to config)



Functions:
    ☐ manage images (delete, list, sort, create (steps/commands before creating, steps/commands after creating, etc.))
    ☐ manage containers (stop, start, restart, add (env variables, name, image (from list or name from dockerhub), how many times), remove, list, sort)
    pipelines:
        ☐ add new (create new pipeline - name - from github repo - trigger mode: from push/manual)
        ☐ tests
        build => tests => deploy to production




.NET CORE 2 approach to pipelines:
    - push new version to master branch =>
    - pull latest version from master branch =>
    - restore dependencies, build and test app =>
    - publish app (dotnet publish) =>
    - push bundled app to release branch


settings:
    - port and ip which continuum is running on
    

    ☐ move settings and logout to profile molecule unveiling menu
